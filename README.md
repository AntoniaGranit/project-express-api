This was our first backend project. I built my own API using Node.js and Express, and a dataset I found on Kaggle. It turned out to be a lot more exciting than I had imagined, and I had a lot of fun manipulating the dataset and creating different endpoints. I also think my API conforms to the RESTful principles.

## The problem
The most difficult part of this week's project was definitely the deployment. Although I did get my API up and running quite quickly, I found Google Cloud difficult to wrap my head around as the UI was messy and the process of deploying a backend project quite intimidating at first.
